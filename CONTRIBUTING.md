## Contributing
Thanks very much for thinking about contributing to yup-by-example, and thanks again for taking the time to read this.

### Issues
If you're having difficulty with yup-by-example, please do create a github issue, but take the time to explain you the situation clearly. Providing a **minmal** script that demonstrates the problem. Format code samples using GitHub markdown.

### How to contribute
If you're only making a minor change, such as fixing a typo in the readme, or obvious bug, please create the PR directly. If the change is more substantial, then please start by opening a new issue and discussing things first. It can save on rework and often ends up in an improved solution in the long run.

yup-by-example is well tested, and I'd like to keep this way. If you're fixing a bug, I'd really appreciate it if the fix came with a test showing the issue, but I wouldn't reject a PR and live with the bug just for the sake of it. If you're submitting a new feature, and it's not something I personally need, then it must come with good test coverage to be accepted.

Otherwise, please make an effort to follow the existing code style/patterns and avoid keep dependencies to a minimum.

Thanks again,

Steve
